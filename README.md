# Unit Testing and Integration Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates the integration of unit testing and integration testing within a CI/CD pipeline. The aim is to ensure code quality and system reliability through automated testing at various stages of the pipeline.

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the software delivery process, enabling faster and more reliable code deployments. This repository provides an overview of how unit testing and integration testing are integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

## Unit Testing

### Definition

Unit testing involves testing individual components of the software, such as functions, methods, or classes, in isolation from the rest of the system.

### Purpose

- Verify that each part of the codebase behaves as expected on its own.
- Catch bugs early in the development cycle.

### Characteristics

- **Isolated:** Tests focus on a single "unit" of code, without external dependencies.
- **Fast:** Since they are small and isolated, unit tests run quickly.
- **Automated:** Typically run automatically by CI tools whenever code is pushed to the repository.
- **Repeatable:** Should produce the same results every time they are run.

### Tools

- **Java:** JUnit, TestNG
- **Python:** PyTest, Unittest
- **JavaScript:** Mocha, Jasmine

### Example

python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0

test_add()




# Integration Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates the integration of integration testing within a CI/CD pipeline. The aim is to ensure system reliability and the correct interaction of various software components through automated testing in the pipeline.

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the software delivery process, enabling faster and more reliable code deployments. This repository provides an overview of how integration testing is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure different parts of the system work together correctly.

## Integration Testing

### Definition

Integration testing involves testing the interactions between different modules or services to ensure they work together as expected.

### Purpose

- Verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- Catch issues that might arise from the integration of components.

### Characteristics

- **Combined Testing:** Tests multiple components together.
- **Environment:** Often requires a more complete environment (e.g., a database, external services).
- **Medium Speed:** Slower than unit tests because they involve more components and interactions.
- **Automated:** Typically run after unit tests in the CI pipeline.

### Tools

- **API Testing:** Postman, SoapUI
- **Web Testing:** Selenium, Cypress
- **Backend Testing:** Testcontainers, Spring Test for Java

### Example

```python
import requests

def test_get_user():
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users/1")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["name"] == "John Doe"

test_get_user()
